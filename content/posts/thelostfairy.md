One day in a forest far away there lived two fairy sisters. But then one morning a terrible storm came and blew one of the sisters far away into the distance, so the other sister (Mery) set off to find her other sister Rose. She climbed through mountains and daring storms but still she was not afraid of the things that lay ahead.

Soon Mery got tired and discoverd a nice cosy cave to take a good nap. In the morning Mery found some familiar foot steps in the soft ground. “I wonder if the familiar foot steps are Rose’s.” Thought Mery. So she kept on going until the foot steps stopped. “I’m doomed.” Cried Mery. But just then Mery spotted a pink dot in the distance so she went to check them out. 
When she got there she realised that these shoes were  Rose’s. Mery hurried far into the distance. She was geting puffed out, so Mery sat down against a tree for a while. Then Mery got up and continued her journey to find her sister. But just then she heard a voice. “Rose,” Mery yelled. “Mery,” replied Rose. “You’re here!” Rose yelled as they ran towards each other. They hugged and hugged and hugged as they walked back home together. 

When they got back home their parents cried with joy that their kids had survived all the terrors and horrors that lay out in the dangerous bad wild. They all talked about the thing that happened on their journey to find Rose after the massive and huge **storm** that blew Rose far far away into the distance. After that Rose’s and mery’s parents started to cry because of thinking about it. After that they lived a really happy life together.

**The End**
